## Introduction

This project is a collection of common **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** implemented in C++. Each data structure and algorithm is well-documented, with examples to help you understand how to use them. 

It is designed for students, developers, and anyone looking to sharpen their problem-solving skills in **C++**.

## Data Structures

### 1. Linear Data Structures
- **Arrays**
  - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Searching
- **Linked List**

  - Priority Queue

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Trees**
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree
  - Heap (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- **Graphs**
  - Adjacency Matrix and List Representation

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Git** and a **C++ compiler** installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohAhmadRaza/DSA-CPP.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA-CPP
   ```

3. Compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`):
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```

4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```

## How to Use

Each folder inside this repository contains the following:
- **Code**: The actual C++ code implementing the data structure or algorithm.
- **Example**: An example or test case demonstrating how to use the code.

### Example

To run an example of a binary search algorithm:

1. Navigate to the binary search directory.
2. Compile and run the code:
   ```bash
   g++ binary_search.cpp -o binary_search
   ./binary_search
   ```
